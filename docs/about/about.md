# About LAGO

The LAGO (Latin American Giant Observatory) project is an extended Astroparticle Observatory at global scale. It is mainly oriented to basic research on three branches of Astroparticle physics: the Extreme Universe, Space Weather phenomena, and Atmospheric Radiation at ground level.

The LAGO detection network consists in single or small arrays of particle [detectors](../activities/detectors.md) at ground level, spanning over different [sites](sites.md) located at significantly different latitudes (currently from Mexico up to the Antarctic region) and different altitudes (from sea level up to more than 5000 meters over sea level), covering a huge range of geomagnetic rigidity cut-offs and atmospheric absorption/reaction levels.

The LAGO project is run by the LAGO Collaboration, a decentralised and distributed collaborative network of more than 90 scientists from more than 25 institutions in 9 Latin American countries (currently Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela) and in Spain. [See the complete list of the collaboration members and their institutions](collaboration.md))

Finally, [detectors](../activities/detectors.md) installed in various universities are used as a tool to [teach students](../activities/teaching.md) about particle and astroparticle physics, in particular by leading them to the measurement of the muon decay.

!!! info

    Technical information is available in the [Lago wiki](http://wiki.lagoproject.net), our working tool (not foreseen for General Public, as it is currently under development and for now is very technical).

    A list of [publications](../publications/articles.md) from the LAGO collaboration and its members is available, as well as some [LAGO talks](../publications/talks.md), where a lot of information can be found.

    Finally, an historical [news page](../news/news.md) lists LAGO milestones as they have been reached.
